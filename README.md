### 🔗 Matrix Chain Multiplication Using Dynamic Programming
# 📚 Overview
Solves the Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) problem using Dynamic Programming to minimize the number of scalar multiplications and find the optimal parenthesization.

Project for CSE246 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at East West University.

# 🛠️ Features
1. Calculates minimum multiplication operations.
2. Outputs optimal parenthesization.
3. Handles multiple matrices dynamically.

# 📑 Tech Stack
Language: C++

Libraries: <bits/stdc++.h>


# 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile: g++ -o matrix_chain matrix_chain.cpp
2. Execute: ./matrix_chain


# 🖥️ Input Format
1. First input: Number of matrices (n).

2. Next n lines: Rows and columns of each matrix.

# 📤 Output
1. Minimum number of scalar multiplications.
2. Optimal parenthesization of matrices.

# 📈 Example Outputs
Example 1:
Input:
3
10 30
30 5
5 60
Output:
Minimum number of operations: 4500
Parenthesization: (A1(A2A3))

Example 2
Input:
4
5 10
10 15
15 20
20 30
Output:
Minimum number of operations: 5250
Parenthesization: ((A1A2)(A3A4))


# 🌟 Future Scope
